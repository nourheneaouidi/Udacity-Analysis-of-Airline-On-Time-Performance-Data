## by (Nourhene Aouidi)
## About the dataset:
The dataset name is "Airline On-Time Performance Data". This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008. In this analysis, I used the 2008 dataset due to its size, and I only used data from the first four months of the year.

## Summary of Findings:
The carrier is the number one cause for flight cancellation, shortly followed by the weather. The gap between both of them is very close. NAS is the third-highest reason for flight cancellation. No flight cancellations have been reported because of security.
Successful companies are attracting more customers with a reasonable delay time, and they cancel fewer flights than most other companies.
On the start and end of weekends, we have more departure delay than on the weekend.
The number of flights is more important than the flights on the weekend.
The airport's location may affect the weather delay, but there must be some other factor contributing to delays.
## Key Insights for Presentation:
Flight cancellations are mostly due to the carrier and the weather, so airlines should prioritize developing strategies to address these issues.
Successful companies attract more customers with fewer delays and fewer cancellations.
Travelers may experience more departure delays on the start and end of weekends.
Airports can have a significant impact on weather delays, but there may be other factors at play that airlines can explore to reduce delays.
